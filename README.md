## Box Drop

Box Drop is a web app which allows local drivers to deliver packages instead of traditional, centralized means of shipment. 

To use our app, you need to open any three html links and navigate to "Deliver", "Receive", and "Drive" in the right-hand navbar of each of the opened windows. This simulates a successful sender-driver-recipient interaction. You can open the links on any device, and they will successfully communicate with each other. 


Our project was made by HTML, CSS, JS while integrating the HERE API to generate maps and Pubnub services to handle the backend services.
